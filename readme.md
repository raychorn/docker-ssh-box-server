## _OpenSSH-Server for Docker_

ssh-box deploys an OpenSSH Server to your host OS via Docker.

- Obviously this was done for Windows because Windows sucks for OpenSSH.

## Features

- Feel free to deploy my public ssh key to your server, if you use this repo.
- I did not include my public key for YOU to use. Duh!
- In case you choose to be lazy and you leave my public key in your deployment, do me a favor and let me know. LOL.

## Installation

```
./docker-up.sh
```
